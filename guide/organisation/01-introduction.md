# Introduction

An election compass (also called a *voting advice application*) is a wonderful tool to help educate
young and old about democracy. It is a great way to get everyone more involved in the election and
can help to make politicians more transparent.
It is simple to use, yet not simple to build. To help everyone run their own election compass, we
wrote this guide. **With your feedback, it will grow over time!**
