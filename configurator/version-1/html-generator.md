# HTML Generator <Badge text="alpha" type="error"/>

This generator compiles the source code of the latest version of the OpenElectionCompass, all associated assets and a given configuration file into a single HTML file. This file can then be easily deployed on a simple webserver. While this method of deployment is not without disadvantages, it is certainly the easiest, self-hosted solution. Simply generate a configuration file using the [Configuration Editor](./configuration-editor.html) and upload it to this generator.
